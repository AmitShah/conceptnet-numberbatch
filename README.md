# conceptnet-vector-ensemble

This repository describes implements an ensemble method that combines
ConceptNet, word2vec, and GloVe using a variation on retrofitting.

The `paper/` directory contains the LaTeX source of our paper.  The `code/`
directory contains a Python module called `conceptnet_retrofitting`,
implementing the code that was used in the paper.

## Downloading the term vectors


## Installing the code

- Install base dependencies such as Python 3, NumPy, and SciPy.

- Install [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com) and
  [ninja](http://ninja-build.org).

- Set up the Python package:

```sh
cd code
python setup.py develop
```

Next you'll need to set up git-annex so you can get the large data files and
track them when they change:

- Read the git-annex walkthrough at
  https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/.  git-annex is very useful but
  you don't want to do anything to your files behind its back. If you find that
  git-annex has prevented you from modifying a file, don't override it. It is
  probably stopping you from doing something dumb.

- Get the files (this should default to downloading them over the web):

```sh
cd code/data
git annex get
```

Finally, start the build process that will create and evaluate the various
spaces of term embeddings that are described in the paper:

```sh
cd ..                # this should return you to the `code/` directory
python ninja.py      # generate the build script
ninja                # run the build
```

## Requirements for building

- A POSIX-compatible system with utilities such as `grep` and `cut`
- **System dependencies**: git-annex, ninja-build, Python 3.3 or later
- **Python dependencies**: numpy, scipy, pandas, ftfy, scikit-learn, wordfreq,
  and ordered-set. These will mostly be installed automatically via `setup.py`,
  but large dependencies such as numpy and scipy may be easier to install
  separately.
- 32 GB of RAM
